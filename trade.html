<h1>Political economy of trade</h1>
  <p> In this project, I analyze the institutional consequences of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). PTAs are institutional 
  arrangements created to regulate trade flows and they are aimed primarily at reducing tariffs, quotas, and duties. Increasingly, 
  these institutional arrangements cover also non-tariffs barriers to trade and entails social and environmental provisions. 
  Therefore, PTAs "tie the hands" of national governments in several policy areas. I hypothesize that the ratification of PTAs leads
  to power delegation from nation-state to regional governments and hence create the premises for the emergence of multi-level 
  governance and regional political revival. </p>
