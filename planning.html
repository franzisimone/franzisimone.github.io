<h1>Planning, urban studies, global cities, and real estate</h1>
  <p>Land is a scarce resource. In a globally urbanized age, land is under pressure by several phenomena: 
  internal and external migration flows that brings more people into cities and urban areas, increasing individual mobility, 
  increasing average acreage per person, tertiarization and servitization of the economy, etc. The way in which we use, distribute, and 
  organize this land is instrumental for today's and future prosperity. Territorial and urban planning remains therefore an
  important task for any type of development, be it social, economic, or environmental. </p>
