  <h1> Global Affairs</h1>
  
<br>
  I conduct research in several subareas of global affairs. Following you can find the different ongoing projects.

<h2>Globalization and the history of international cooperation</h2>
  <p> In order to understand globalization, i.e. the process of increasing interconnectedness among different regions, 
    countries, nations, and cultures, we need to trace its origins and the evolution of the interactions among differently organized
    societies around the globe. This research project is an exercise on tracing the evolution of the interactions among a diverse array 
    of institutional settings.

<h2>Political economy of trade</h2>
  <p> In this project, I analyze the institutional consequences of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). PTAs are institutional 
  arrangements created to regulate trade flows and they are aimed primarily at reducing tariffs, quotas, and duties. Increasingly, 
  these institutional arrangements cover also non-tariffs barriers to trade and entails social and environmental provisions. 
  Therefore, PTAs "tie the hands" of national governments in several policy areas. I hypothesize that the ratification of PTAs leads
  to power delegation from nation-state to regional governments and hence create the premises for the emergence of multi-level 
  governance and regional political revival. </p>
